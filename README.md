# WorldHeritages
Android app for helping people discover World Heritageso around the planet.

This app uses, among others: Koin, Coil, Android Jetpack Paging Library and Room.

## TODOs:

- Add a MapFragment showing the location of a heritage when a user taps on an item in the list of heritages.
 - Make Instrumented tests work, as the paging library seems to show no content at all when the fragment is loaded.
 - Include heritage search.
 - Improve UI.
